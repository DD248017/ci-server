# üöÄ DD2480 Assignment 2 Overview

This project involves developing a lightweight Continuous Integration (CI) server that automatically compiles, tests, and reports build results for a given repository. The CI server listens for webhook triggers from GitHub, pulls the latest code changes, and runs `mvn compile` and `mvn test` to ensure code integrity. It then notifies users of the build results through commit status updates or email notifications. The project also requires proper repository structuring, clear documentation, and adherence to software engineering best practices, including well-structured commits and collaboration. Additionally, advanced features like build history tracking and enhanced automation can be implemented for distinction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Components:

- **Compilation**:

  - The CI server support compiling the project when triggered by a webhook.
  - It fetch the latest code from the specified branch and run mvn compile.

- **Automated Testing**:

  - The CI server run mvn test upon receiving a webhook event.
  - The Ci server recives the specific branch in the webhook payload where the change was made.
  - The CI server detects changes and execute the appropriate tests.

- **CI Result Notification**:

  - The CI server notifies users about build results through commit status updates via the GitHub REST API.

- **Version Control and Traceability**:

  - Each CI run is associated with a specific Git commit.
  - The CI server maintains a history of past builds, with each build having a unique URL for logs.

- **Documentation**:

  - All public classes and methods have API documentation (e.g., JavaDoc).
  - A comprehensive README, documentingÔºö
    - How to set up and run the CI server
    - Dependencies and required configurations
    - Contributions of team members
    - How the CI server is implemented and tested

- **Webhook Configuration**:

  - Configure GitHub to trigger the CI server by setting the webhook URL to point to your CI server's public URL form ngrok.

- **URLS**:

```console
/webhook              for webook listener
```

```console
/history              history of the past builds
```

```console
/docs                 for documentation
```

```console
/health               for server health check
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Project with Maven

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have Maven and Java installed. The required versions are:

- **Maven version:** apache-maven-3.9.9
- **Java version:** 17.0.2

If you haven‚Äôt installed Maven yet, follow the instructions [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

Then you need to generate a personal github token [here]https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens

After that add it as a system enviroment varible called GITHUB_TOKEN.

### Build the Project

To compile and package the project, run:

```console
mvn clean install
```

### Run the Application

Execute the following command to start the application:

```console
mvn exec:java
```

### Running Tests

#### Run All Tests

To execute all test cases, use:

```console
mvn test
```

#### Run single test

To run a specific test class, for example CompileServiceTest use:

```console
mvn test -Dtest=CompileServiceTest
```

## Test Builds Folder

The testBuilds.zip file contains builds used for testing core functions.
